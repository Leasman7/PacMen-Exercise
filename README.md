# PacMen-Exercise

This is a "game" with two buttons on the screen: "Add Pacman" and "Start Game." The former button adds a small pacman image to the screen. The latter button updates the pacmen positions so they move around the screen, at differing speeds and directions.

## How to Run:
Download index and javascript files, as well as the pacmen images and save them all in the same folder. Then simply drag and drop the index file into the browser to view the working code. Any modification would require a file editor such as VS Code.

## Roadmap:
It would be fun to figure out how to make it so that the pacmen appear facing different directions and so that they face the direction they are moving. The other modification that has occurred to me is editing the pacmen themselves so that they aren't all the same color or possibly size. However, as I understand it, I would need to edit and include all of those different images, and I don't want it to get too clogged up.
